# About us #

We are an international development team from all around the world creating applications and web sites. This is our main page where we host projects and information under. You can find some of our locally published pages as well as entirely different websites hosted under *mavulp.com* in the *Pages* section.

Keep in mind that Mavulp is a collective meaning although the entire team is in charge of this site, content is written and attributed to members as it is created. This site acts more as a place where everything comes together.

The site runs on a locally hosted Raspberry Pi which we still had laying around from the days when *Hivecom* was still called *Hivemind*. Years ago. It's back in action now and serving a good purpose though!
