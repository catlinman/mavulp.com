# Summary #

This is a hidden page. The main use of it in this directory is for testing and to have the directory in commits. All pages placed in the hidden directory are build and can be accessed just like other pages but do not show up anywhere and can't be easily found.

If you didn't figure it out, *7c89b7* is the start of the MD5 hash *"Hidden Page"* which results to 7c89b7f56cf2379fc146403473004f61.
